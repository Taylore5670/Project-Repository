Interviewer: Can you state your name for the record?

SUBJECT: I... I’d rather not. Let’s just stick with SUBJECT for now. That’s what I go by. No names.  

Interviewer: Understood. Can you tell us about your friends, RABBIT and SPIRIT BEAR?

SUBJECT: Yeah... they’re, uh, they're my two closest friends. But... I don’t think they know everything about me. They don’t know... that I changed my mind. I used to be evil, you know? I did bad things. Hurt people. Didn’t mean to, but I did. I can't undo that.

Interviewer: You said you changed your mind about being evil. What do you mean by that?

SUBJECT: It’s not as simple as it sounds. I—I was bad, yeah. I did things I’m not proud of. But I don’t want to hurt anyone anymore. I’ve been trying to make up for it. Trying to help people recover from what I did. But... I think... RABBIT and SPIRIT, they don’t know I’m trying to change. They still see me as the same person. They think I’ll help them with whatever... plans they have.

Interviewer: You think they might betray you?

SUBJECT: I’m not sure. Something’s off. RABBIT and SPIRIT need me, but they don’t know what I’m thinking now. They don't see how far I've come, or how I’ve changed. And I—I think they might... I think they might be planning something. I just don’t want to be involved if it’s gonna hurt anyone. I don’t want to hurt anyone.

Interviewer: What about your best friend, CTW? You mentioned they stopped talking to you.

SUBJECT: Yeah... that’s... that’s a tough one. CTW, they don’t talk to me anymore. They’ve moved on, I guess. New job, new friends. I tried reaching out, but it’s like they don’t want anything to do with me now. It's probably for the best. They don’t need someone like me around. But it still hurts, you know?

Interviewer: You mentioned sending an apology to one of your past victims. What was that about?

SUBJECT: I—yeah, I did. It wasn’t much, but I had to. I couldn’t just... ignore the past. I had to send it. I don’t know if it helped, but I had to try. I’ve done a lot of bad things, and if I can do one good thing for someone I hurt... maybe it’s a start. Maybe I’m not beyond redemption. 

Interviewer: You seem conflicted about your past. Do you think you can ever fully make up for what you’ve done?

SUBJECT: I don’t know. I don’t know if I can. I can’t take back the things I did. But I can try to do better now. Maybe that’s all I can do. I just... don’t want to hurt anyone again. I don’t know if that’s enough. But I’ll keep trying.

Interviewer: Thank you for speaking with us today.

SUBJECT: Yeah... thanks. Just, uh, keep it to yourself. No one needs to know everything.
